# Instacart Customer Segmentation and Sales Analysis

Instacart is a leading online grocery platform offering a wide range of products via its app. Although sales are strong, the company is seeking deeper insights into customer behavior and sales patterns to support targeted marketing and improve overall performance. This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, customer segments, and actionable recommendations.
